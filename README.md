# Combinatorial-Data-Mapping
### TODO: 

- [ ] Make ability to have multiple files under the same structure
- [ ] Make a gui for ease of use
  - [ x ] make a tab to add fileStructures, and add files/ file data
  - [ ] be able to fiew the files from within the gui
  - [ ] be able to get certain data from a given file
  - [ ] make a debug console tab if the console does not print anything out anymore

- [ ] fix sloppy code
  - instead of adding "{" and "}" to the start and end of the inputs and outputs, add them to a map and then add that map to the main map
  - if you have to put the maps back into a string before putting to file, see if its worth it to do.  If its not, condence the code into a JSON parser in Utils for ease of use
